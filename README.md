# Missile Command

A recreation of Atari's game "Missile Command" using Python, completed with a neon-aesthetic loading screen and a few additional tweaks to make the experience even more enjoyable.  Have fun, and don't lose!

# Demo
Beware! The window size for Repl differs from Python's and unfortunately cuts off the top half of the game screen, meaning you only have half the experience! For the best gameplay, I would recommend the reader to download the file and run locally, the Repl below is just a sneak peak.
For (half) a demo, follow [this link](https://repl.it/@bonniepeng/missile-command#main.py) into the Repl and run.
